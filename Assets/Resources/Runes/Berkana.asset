  runeDescription: Berkana is the rune of birth. It represents the Birch Goddess
    and so indicates fertility and creation, not just of an actual birth (its traditional
    meaning), but also of projects, partnerships and rebirth. It indicates mental
    and physical growth, and a regenerative power and liberation of spirit
