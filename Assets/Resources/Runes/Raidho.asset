  runeDescription: "Raidho is associated with the movement: atoms, blood, planets,
    the Sun itself. The rune is all about roads; it means that you're on the way.
    Trust the course of events and yourself. Do not waste your time on unnecessary
    reasoning and doubts \u2013 just keep walking."
