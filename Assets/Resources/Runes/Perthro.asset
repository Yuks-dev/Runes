  runeDescription: "This is the gambler\u2019s rune and as such represents the cup
    of dice, or fortune. It indicates that influences in life may be down to chance,
    and so can go either well or not. The lesson here is to learn to take the hand
    you\u2019ve been dealt and make lemonade out of lemons. In Tarot, this is would
    be similar to the Wheel of Fortune card. It can also represent hidden meanings,
    secrets, and change"
