  runeDescription: Gebo means gift, but it is also the rune of partnership, union,
    and relations. It's a value, but not something you can buy or sell. The rune
    indicates collaboration and creation in any form. If you are striving to complete
    a project successfully, look for allies and start working with them. You are
    on the right track.
