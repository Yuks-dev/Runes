  runeDescription: "Laguz represents water \u2014 the flow of life. It's a force
    that carries and supports you. Another meaning of the rune is intuition, some
    practical knowledge. Laguz is void of aggression. It teaches you to adapt to
    the circumstances without changing your inner self. You're led and protected
    by high energies."
