  runeDescription: Hagalaz represents hail. This natural form of disaster which strikes
    out of the blue and has the power to destroy much needed crops, is similarly
    indicative of sudden and cataclismic change. Similar to The Tower card in the
    tarot, Hagalaz represents an unavoidable change that is out of our hands, but
    how destructive it ends up being is dependant on whether we are capable of weathering
    its storm with grace. As they say, some storms come to clear our path. The lesson
    of Hagalaz is to learn from our hardships and grow through our mistakes
