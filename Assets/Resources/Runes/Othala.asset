  runeDescription: The key features of Othala are belonging (to a group) and ownership
    (rights within the group). The rune gives a sense of confidence, irreplaceability,
    and purpose. Othala foretells an acquisition. It is linked to the concept of
    kindred and ancestry. It can sometimes predict death because inheritance always
    comes after someone dies.
