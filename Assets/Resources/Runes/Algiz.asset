  runeDescription: Algiz is the elk, and so represents defence and protection. If
    you get this one, it means that you have the internal power to manifest your
    dreams and that your spirit guides are protecting you along your path. It is
    said to act as a shield to guard you against evil. It can also represent an awakening
    and strong intuition
