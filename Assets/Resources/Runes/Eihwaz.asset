  runeDescription: Eihwaz is related to Yggdrasil, the sacred tree of Norse cosmology.
    It is a rune of transition, past, present, and future; sometimes, it is linked
    with death. Eihwaz indicates certain obstacles but also promises a favorable
    outcome. It protects you from evil and provides help from ancestors.
