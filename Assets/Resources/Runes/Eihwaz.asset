  runeDescription: In Norse mythology, the Yew tree, Yggradisil, is representative
    of The Tree Of Life. As such, it relates to the cycle of life, similar to the
    Death Tarot card (signifying the dying of an old way of being or period of life).
    It can also represent reliability, dependability, trustworthiness, enlightenment,
    and a sense of purpose, symbolising the connection between all the worlds
