  runeDescription: "Nauthiz is indicative of our needs. What do you need to feel
    emotionally stable and fulfilled? Are you taking enough time for yourself to
    balance work, play and rest? Assessing what are our needs and where we may currently
    be lacking can help us take better care of our future selves, we can\u2019t pour
    form an empty cup after all. It can also indicate delays, restriction, and endurance.
    This is a time to practice patience"
