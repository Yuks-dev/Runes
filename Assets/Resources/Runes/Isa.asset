  runeDescription: Isa is tangible, solid, inert, and overpoweringly forceful, like
    Scandinavian ice. Everything that surrounds you will resist your forward movement,
    and your progress will slow down. The rune brings stagnation and obstacles, a
    spiritual standstill. Keep calm and wait for the hefty slab of ice blocking your
    path to slowly melt and flow away.
