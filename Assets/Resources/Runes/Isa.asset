  runeDescription: "Isa represents ice. It\u2019s symbolic of the Hangman card in
    the Tarot. It highlights the need to pause, wait, although there may be a feeling
    of being stuck in ice, sometimes a break is what\u2019s needed to put things
    into perspective. Waiting until we have gathered all the information, all sides
    of the story, properly done our research, or simply allowed the Universe to unfold.
    It can also indicate frustration or psychological blocks"
