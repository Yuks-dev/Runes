  runeDescription: "Jera is representative of the harvest. It indicates that we can
    now reap what we\u2019ve sown and enjoy our plentiful abundance. If you don\u2019t
    feel like you have many blessings, it can show that either a breakthrough is
    on the way, or it\u2019s time to take stock and express gratitude for what you
    do have! It also represents the life cycle and cyclic nature of Mother Earth"
