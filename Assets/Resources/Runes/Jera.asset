  runeDescription: Jera represents a favorable outcome, a plentiful harvest, and
    the time and actions needed to let crops give that harvest. Jera is all about
    time and the reward that awaits you, but only if you work hard and long enough
    despite difficulties and lack of understanding. It indicates a positive outcome,
    legal power, and financial inflow.
