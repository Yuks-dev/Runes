  runeDescription: 'Tiwaz represents the Great Warrior, who once put his hand into
    the wolf''s mouth. The rune is all about getting ready to sacrifice. It indicates
    an active period in your life. There may be battles, fights, adventures, stress,
    important events. But patience can also help: some fortresses can only be gained
    by siege.'
